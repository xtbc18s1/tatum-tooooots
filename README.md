Project 2 for Xtern Bootcamp 2018 Session 1. Yay, JavaScript!

## Day 4 Homework

* Make the _delete_ button work, if you haven't already.
* Make the _fav_ button change the style of the list item in some way.

### Bonus Credit

* Make the _fav_ button also change the object in the array. For example:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  name: 'GI Joe',
  fav: true,
}
```

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Add buttons to move the flick up and down the list.
* Make the buttons also change their position in the array.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting

* Allow users to edit the names of the flicks in the list after they're added.

(Wouldn't it be nice if we could make that span's **content editable**?)
